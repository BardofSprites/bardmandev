#+TITLE: Notes

These are a selection of notes that I am willing to share. I'm sharing them for a reason, but try not to just rip them off as your own. I like to put time into information that I am going to share. That being said, there can be mistakes. Please [[/contact][contact]] me if you find any mistakes.

Some notes are pdfs. These pdfs are are generated with GNU Emacs Org Mode that is exported to LaTeX.
