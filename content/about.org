* Possible FAQ
** About this website
*** Why did you make this site?
I was inspired by [[https://protesilaos.com/][Protesilaos Stavrou]] and [[https://landchad.net][Luke Smith]] to start my own web page. Having your own web page is a kind of social media, but more customized. I also wanted to make tutorials, and having them written out is a medium that is not often utilized.
*** How does your site work?
I write this site in [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] markup and then [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] turns it into a static website. I have taken and heavily modified Luke Smiths [[https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lugo][lugo]] theme for Hugo. The colorscheme is more or less the same as [[https://protesilaos.com/assets/images/modus/modus-vivendi-org.png][modus-vivendi]]. The background from the home page is a grey-scaled version of the title screen from Streets of Rage (a video game).
