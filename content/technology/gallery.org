** XMonad and Ef Elea Dark Theme
It's summer time :D

Open windows (L-> R): Emacs with [[https://github.com/BardofSprites/conductor][conductor]] project, nsxiv, Emacs with notmuch, Emacs with [[/technology/elfeed][Elfeed]], Emacs calendar, Emacs with [[/technology/emms][EMMS]].

Lately I have been refining my email workflow with Emacs, might make an article about how I do it in the future when the school year starts.

And also, I randomly found out that Emacs can use true transparency, and I love it so much better than picom.

** WindowMaker Scylla Theme and Gruber Darker
I have been toying around with [[https://windowmaker.org][WindowMaker]] for around a week. My favorite feature (unsurprisingly if you check the post below) would be the dock.

The open windows are Emacs ~dired~, ~nsxiv~ image viewer and ~URxvt~ with ~tmux~. The wallpaper is doctored with the calendar generated by my [[https://github.com/BardofSprites/dotfiles-stow/blob/master/bin/.local/bin/scripts/wallpaper-annotate.sh][wallpaper-annotate.sh]]

** FVWM3 With Gruber Darker on Artix-openrc
I played with [[https://www.windowmaker.org/][WindowMaker]] for a little bit. I didn't actually end up liking or using it, but I did enjoy the [[https://www.dockapps.net/][dockapps]]. I swallowed these little widgets into the left panel that I have on the side. The bar has wmcore, ~wmacpi~, ~wmamixer~, ~wmusic~, and ~wmclock~. The grid on the top is ~FvwmPager~ and the window list is ~FvwmIconMan~.

The windows shown are Emacs with a lisp project open (so I can look super productive) and a terminal running ~fastfetch~ (I have it aliased to neofetch). I finally wrote an Fvwm colorset when I figured out which colors I like for
