* The Beginning: IDE phase
When I was a baby developer on Windows 10, I started development for a python course using their online editor. After getting past the basics of the programming language, my teacher let me begin using a real IDE for my homework and projects.

Because I was working with python, I started using pycharm. It was good for what I needed. At one point, I even thought that I would need to buy the commercial version of the software.

* The Middle: Neovim
In the spring of my freshman year of high school, I started looking at Linux as a possible rabbit hole to go down. My friend showed me screenshots of desktop configurations from the r/unixporn subreddit. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/uoskpi/qtile_i_know_it_isnt_groundbreaking_but_this_is/][This post]] is what I looked at when starting to customize my Linux desktop.

I was like:

#+begin_quote
/Woah, that's pretty cool. I want a desktop like that./
#+end_quote

My friend guided me through the Pop!_OS installation. I used it for a while and am still nostalgic for those early discover days where I would be looking up:

#+begin_quote:
how to install window manager in gnome.

what is mutter.

why can't I install another window manager in gnome

how to remove mutter window manager

can i switch mutter window manager for awesome window manager qtile

qtile window manager

After learning the basics of apt with the power of google, I had begun using desktop Linux for studying/doing homework.

In the screenshot, I saw that there was a program called neovim, but I didn't understand its purpose for a long period of time. Nonetheless, I hopped to neovim for the same reason I hopped to Linux: the themes. In particular, it was [[https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim][the kanagawa theme]]. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/vctu8a/2bwm_kanagawa_is_probably_one_of_the_best_color/][Here]] is the post that piqued my interest in this theme.

The kanagawa theme was for a program called neovim, and I wanted to use the theme so bad that I learned how to use it.

I found a configuration framework called NvChad and I used this during my Computer Science classes for a while.

After certain frustrations with keybinds and defaults, I went down the vanilla neovim rabbit hole with the Primagen and started configurating stuff on my own.

* The End?: Emacs
My first taste of Emacs was when I saw Distrotube make videos of DOOM Emacs.
