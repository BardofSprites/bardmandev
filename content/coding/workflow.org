#+title: My Emacs Workflow For Programming, Notetaking, and Much More

* Prefrace
I use Emacs everyday on all of my computers. It is my favorite program on my computer. I use it for school and personal use, and only on Linux. I have a separate configuration on my [[https://github.com/BardofSprites/.emacs.d][Emacs repository]] on the minimal branch that is lighter weight for my school computer.

* General Packages
** Editing Extensions
*expand-region:* This extension is really useful for selecting text. It's like a dwim solution for selecting text. You can repeatedly run the same key-sequence (I use C-=) and select a larger amount of text for every tool.

*tempel:* This is a package for snippets. You can define text snippets in a lisp-like syntax. It's very conventient for quick snippets like this:

** Refractoring Tools with wgrep and substitute
My workflow for large text operations was completely copied from [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=3638][this irreal post]]. Basically the idea is this:

#+begin_quote

    1. Call grep/rgrep/consult-grep to get a list of every occurrence of the function name. If consult-grep, use embark to export to buffer.
    2. Call wgrep so that you can edit the rgrep output and have the results reflected in the original files.
    3. Call substitute to change every instance of the function name at once.
    4. Quit wgrep, writing the changes back to the files.

#+end_quote

** Snippets with tempel
Snippets are a really helpful way of reducing time spent retyping the same things over and over again. I use snippets for common phrases and elisp functions that I type often.

** File Management with dired

** Window Management

* Programming
** Languages
*** Major Modes
I have a few packages installed for the various programming languauges that I like to dabble in. Here they are in list format, because they don't a lot to talk about.

1. ~clojure-mode~
2. ~haskell-mode~
3. ~ada-mode~

*** Repl - Cider, Sly, Geiser

** Language Server (LSP)
Eglot just works, and it's built into Emacs. I mainly use it with clangd for C++. I don't really need it for other langs.

** Completion

** Git

* Writing
** org-mode
Org mode is one of the pillars of Emacs. It is not just a markdown clone
** denote
** denote-menu and denote-explore
** Editing extensions

* Time Management and Scheduling
** todo.org file
** ~tmr~
~tmr~ is a simple package for managing timers. I use it to tell when I need to get up and walk around after studying for around 60 min.

* Media
** Multimedia with EMMS
** RSS Feeds with elfeed
elfeed-org and goodies
** Emails with notmuch 
** IRC
* "Frivoulous" Items
** Modus and Ef Themes
As I stated in my [[/enjoy/programs][opinionated list of programs]], I like to 
** Fontaine
** Spacious Padding
** Cursory
