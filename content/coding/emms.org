* Description
From the official page: 
#+begin_quote
Emms is the Emacs Multimedia System. Emms displays and plays multimedia from within GNU/Emacs using a variety of external players and from different sources.

...

Emms can run as a minimalist player and controlled with a handful of M-x Emacs commands, or a fully-fledged, interactive media browser. Emms can display album art, play streaming audio, tag music files, search for lyrics, provide MPD connectivity, control the volume, and more. 
#+end_quote
I cannot describe it better, this tool exemplifies the Emacs golden standard for extensibility and practicality.

* Installation
EMMS is official GNU software, which means that it is available through the [[https://elpa.gnu.org/][GNU ELPA]] repository.

EMMS uses an external player, so you will need one. MPV is what I use, but you can use VLC, MPD, and others (as described in the manual).

* Example Configuration
This is a simple ~use-package~ declaration that sets up some simple keybinds.
#+begin_src lisp
  (use-package emms
    :ensure t
    :bind
    (:map emms-playlist-mode-map
          ("M-<f8>" . emms-browser)
          ("A" . emms-add-directory)
          ("T" . emms-add-directory-tree)
          ("F" . emms-add-file)
          ("U" . emms-add-url)
          ("L" . emms-toggle-repeat-track)
          ("<mouse-3>" . emms-pause)
          ("<SPC>" . emms-pause))
    :bind ("<f8>" . emms))
#+end_src

* How I Like To Use It
I have my music saved as mp3 files. Sometimes I download longer mixes from YouTube with ~yt-dlp~ as mp4 or webm (usually mp4). I don't need much in a multimedia player, and EMMS provides it.

Normally my process for playing music is like this:
1. Open emms with ~<f8>~.
2. Click the ~A~ key to add a subdirectory in from my music library.
3. Then I pick the song I want to listen to and start working.
