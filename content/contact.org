* Email:
+ develop.bard at gmail dot com is my main public email
+ For classmates, please use my school email; if you are supposed to know, you know.

I get a lot of emails, but I will try to respond within 48 hours.

* Social Media
I'm not on instagram, facebook, snapchat, twitter, or most social media

* Other messaging
** XMPP
+bardman@07f.de+
I don't check this often either, but here it is anyway.

** IRC:
bardman@irc.libera.chat

Email is probably the best way to reach me, I don't have an IRC client on my phone.

** Matrix:
+@bardman:matrix.org+

I don't like matrix anymore, my account will stay but it is unlikely that I will answer

* YouTube
