Introduction and Background
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>I have been preparing for starting my University journey this fall and with that comes <del>spring</del> summer cleaning of my notes. This is something I kind of look for because it gives me an excuse to reevaluate my workflow for notes. I stay away from this during the school year, <em>typically</em>, but summer time is good for re-evaluating my workflows.</p>
<p>
Something that was always confusing for me was the usecase for Denote&#39;s <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote-sequence">sequence</a> and <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote-silo">silo</a> features. I wanted to figure out a way that I could use them. And that is precisely what I achieved recently.</p>

How I Decided To Use Denote Silo Functionality
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>I have a lot of old notes from past classes that I have taken, but rarely reference. I still want to hold onto them. It just feels bad to throw away information that I have synthesized into a way that I understand. I may work on something related to the notes that I took, or take a class with similar topics (e.g. AP United States History notes will apply to an American History course more or less)</p>
<p>
As such, I have created a silo for my old notes in <code>~/Notes/Old Notes</code> and they have a structure like this:</p>
<div class="src src-sh">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#fff;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>  tree <span style="color:#79a8ff">&#34;~/Notes/Old Notes/&#34;</span> -d -L <span style="color:#00bcff">2</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  /home/bard/Notes/Old Notes/
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Old Notes <span style="color:#00d3d0">(</span>2022-2023<span style="color:#00d3d0">)</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Old Notes <span style="color:#00d3d0">(</span>2024-2025<span style="color:#00d3d0">)</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#00bcff">4</span> directories</span></span></code></pre></div>

Not the most traditional method
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Now I know that this isn&#39;t the way your really &#34;supposed to do it&#34;. The traditional way (as far as Org Roam/denote) would suggest the user to put all of their notes in a single directory. But for me the Old Notes silo is an organizational barrier to <em>let go</em>  of my old notes. This not only removes the temptation to reorganize them to fit a new note taking convention that I have taken up, but also de-clutters my current working notes directory from quasi-irrelevant ones.</p>

How howm Inspired Me To Take Another Look
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>It was today (date of writing) that I finally figured out how anyone could make sense of a possible use case for this. This surprised me, especially as someone who has loosely &#34;studied&#34; note-taking and organization for about 3 years through YouTube content and blog posts. This insight came up as a random thought that popped up when I was taking an n-th look at <a href="https://github.com/kaorahi/howm/">howm</a>. I think the home page and it&#39;s minimal approach to linking between files was the main drawing factor, but at the end of the day I have a system that already works for me.</p>
<p>
I had recently (in the past year or so) taken up interest in it again because of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1x_UM0HDhE">a video by qnnnp</a>, aka –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –°—É—Ö–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π, that details his <em>zettlekasten-esque</em> workflow using this tool. I think that this video is an awesome introduction to an efficient system of note taking in Emacs. He uses a basically default Emacs which I can say is just as cool to me as someone with a <a href="https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.pdf">super riced out Emacs system like tecosaur</a> (a 317 page pdf üíÄ).</p>
<p>
–°—É—Ö–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π comes at it with the approach of a –ö–∞—Ä—Ç–æ—Ç–µ–∫–∞ system (zettlekasten). He makes physical card notes and then transfers them into the indexing system. There&#39;s something about the simplicity of this (not that my system is complicated) that is satisfying.</p>
<p>
This video got me thinking again about how my system currently works. And I arrived a this conclusion:</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-6">
The &#34;New?&#34; System
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Basically when I create a note, a simple process happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a note (with denote prompts like title and keywords)</li>
<li>
<p>Then I think about how it could relate to a possible topic that I have written about before</p>
<ol>
<li>Link if necessary</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Write the note</li>
</ol>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-7">
How does this relate to sequence
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Well that&#39;s a good question. The sequence can lie in the second step. I have been organizing notes with their topical <em>meta-note</em> using <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote-org">denote-org&#39;s</a> dynamic block automatic linking. But I have realized that a better way of doing this is by trying to incorporate the notes into a possible sequence. As I discover more about a topic I can do this:</p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#fff;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2;"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span style="display:flex;"><span>20250716T201152==1--tea-research__research.org
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>20250123T053843==1=1--effects-of-roasted-green-tea-on-human-responses__research.org
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>20250313T191558==1=2--green-tea-consumption-and-cognitive-function__research.org
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>20250313T203914==1=3--green-tea-enhances-parieto-frontal-connectivity__research.org
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>20250313T213601==1=4--the-cognitive-benefits-of-
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   green-tea-the-neural-and-behavioral-effects__research_writing.org</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
<code class="verbatim">Now what is this?</code></p>
<p>
I was doing a research paper project in English class last school year (really just a few months ago). I was researching green tea because it&#39;s something I enjoy. I wrote some annotated bibliographies for sources because it was a requirement for the project. I found today that the above format is the best way to organize them. </p>
<p>
It all starts with the first not at the top, it&#39;s the beginning of the sequence (parent). It has the signature of <code>==1</code> which is a &#34;top-level&#34; signature. If I decide to have another sequenced topic, it will start with a <code>==2</code>.</p>
<p>
The subsequent notes underneath are children of this main topic of tea research.</p>
<p>
So it&#39;s better visualized like this:</p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#fff;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2;"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span style="display:flex;"><span>==1__green-tea-cognition
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ==1_1__roasted-green-tea-human-responses
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ==1=2__consumption-and-cognition
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ==1=3__parieto-frontal-connectivity
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ==1=4__cognitive-benefits-paper</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
