The Beginning: IDE phase

The Middle: Neovim
</h2>

<p>In the spring of my freshman year of high school, I started looking at Linux as a possible rabbit hole to go down. My friend showed me screenshots of desktop configurations from the r/unixporn subreddit. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/uoskpi/qtile_i_know_it_isnt_groundbreaking_but_this_is/">This post</a> is what I looked at when starting to customize my Linux desktop.</p>
<p>

<figure class="centered-image"><img src="/img/original_rice.png" title="r/unixporn"><figcaption>the screenshot the started it all</figcaption></figure>
</p>
<p>
I was like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Woah, that&#39;s pretty cool. I want a desktop like that.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
My friend guided me through the Pop!_OS installation. I used it for a while and am still nostalgic for those early discover days where I would be looking up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how to install window manager in gnome.</p>
<p>
what is mutter.</p>
<p>
why can&#39;t I install another window manager in gnome</p>
<p>
how to remove mutter window manager</p>
<p>
can i switch mutter window manager for awesome window manager qtile</p>
<p>
qtile window manager</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
After learning the basics of apt with the power of google, I had begun using desktop Linux for studying/doing homework.</p>
<p>
In the screenshot, I saw that there was a program called neovim, but I didn&#39;t understand its purpose for a long period of time. Nonetheless, I hopped to neovim for the same reason I hopped to Linux: the themes. In particular, it was <a href="https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim">the kanagawa theme</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/vctu8a/2bwm_kanagawa_is_probably_one_of_the_best_color/">Here</a> is the post that piqued my interest in this theme.</p>
<p>
The kanagawa theme was for a program called neovim, and I wanted to use the theme so bad that I learned how to use it.</p>
<p>
I found a configuration framework called NvChad and I used this during my Computer Science classes for a while.</p>
<p>
After certain frustrations with keybinds and defaults, I went down the vanilla neovim rabbit hole with the Primagen and started configurating stuff on my own.</p>

The End?: Emacs

<p>My first taste of Emacs was when I saw Distrotube make videos of DOOM Emacs.</p>
