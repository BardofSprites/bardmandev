<p>I want my programs to be minimal, but not the point of being completely featureless. I&#39;m can&#39;t use a TTY for browsing the modern web. I&#39;m also don&#39;t need to use the behemoth that is the Gnome desktop environment. I use something in between these two.</p>

3. Aesthetically Pleasing
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The main reason why I got into Linux was to make my desktop look nice (no really). I stayed because of the utilities that are commonly associated with it. The programs I use should not be ugly and clunky.</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t go as extreme as the average hyprland zoomer and make my windows 30% opacity with rounded corners and animations, or the boomer with default themes for everything. I like to keep my programs functionally aesthetic.</p>

Why Choose These Tools Over Windows/MacOS
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>I can&#39;t change many default behaviours of these proprietary operating systems. I want to enjoy using my computer. The tools that make my computing experience enjoyable work best on linux. If I didn&#39;t have a choice, like in a work environment, I would have to comply. However, my preference would still be for Linux.</p>

Operating System
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>GNU/Linux is my favorite choice for desktop computing. In the past I have used: PopOs!, Manjaro, ArcoLinux, Debian, Ubuntu Server.</p>
<p>
I settled with Debian and Gentoo as my main choices. Gentoo for my desktop and laptop, Debian 12 for my home server.</p>
<p>
<strong>Pros of Debian:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>quick to setup and easy to maintain</li>
<li>wide range of avaiable software/drivers</li>
<li>stable</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons of Debian</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>systemd</li>
<li>not as minimal as Gentoo</li>
<li>outdated versions of some packages</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros of Gentoo:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ability to meticulously control everything about your system â†’ how unstable/stable it is, how minimal it is, and so on</li>
<li>compiling packages may increase performance</li>
<li>more init system choices (systemd, openrc, etc)</li>
<li>more benefits <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Benefits_of_Gentoo">here</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons of Gentoo</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>not easy to setup/maintain for most people</li>
<li>a pretty significant time investment</li>
<li>takes a long time to install (might be my fault)</li>
<li>compiling packages can take a long time</li>

Web Browsing: Firefox and Librewolf
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-3">
<p>These are easy to use and don&#39;t eat up as much RAM as chromium. They are also both free and open source which makes it easier to install them on linux.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-9" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-9">
Extensions/Addons
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-4">
<p>I don&#39;t use many extensions. Bitwarden is a password manager that I highly recommend. I also really like Tridactyl, a vim browsing extension. It provides vim bindings for actions like clicking on links, switching tabs, scrolling, etc. It&#39;s great because I never have to touch my mouse </p>

<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Both browsers can use a userChrome.css for customizing the interface. I use the <a href="https://github.com/Dook97/firefox-qutebrowser-userchrome">i3wm lookalike theme</a>.</p>

Why Do I Have Two Browsers?
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-4">
<p>I like to seperate school/home browsing. Also some websites, like twitch.tv, don&#39;t allow Librewolf users to log in because the browser is <em>&#34;unsupported&#34;</em> even though I can watch streams perfectly fine. In this case I just use Firefox as a backup.</p>

Text Editor: GNU Emacs
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-3">
<p>This has been text editor of choice since I found DOOM emacs in 2022. I really like the extensible nature of Emacs lisp and the packages that are avaiable. If you want to here more about my Emacs workflow, click <a href="/coding/workflow">here</a>.</p>

Window Manager - DWM
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-3">
<p>I have jumped between different WMs. First preconfigured dwm on arcolinux, then i3, then xmonad, and then to Luke Smith&#39;s dwm with my own configurations.</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t see myself moving away from dwm anytime soon. Every feature that Luke patched in was exactly what I needed. The only things I changed were the keybinds because a lot of them were overly redundant.</p>

Media
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-2">
<p><strong>MPV:</strong> I use this to play video files that I download from the internet/produce myself. It never lags and the UI is functionally minimal. I don&#39;t customize it or script it with the Lua programming language. I use mpv to play video files from the command line.</p>
<p>
<strong>Emacs:</strong> Emacs has a package called EMMS (Emacs Multi Media System) that I have been using since my start with DOOM Emacs. It uses MPV to play music/videos with Emacs. It&#39;s very convenient as a music player because you can create playlists with Emacs text buffers. <a href="/emacs/emms">Here</a> is a more extensive description of my multimedia workflow with Emacs.</p>

Terminal - ST Suckless Terminal
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-16" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Suckless terminal (st): It is fast, never crashes, minimal, and full of features. Since it is a suckless tool, you start with the original codebase and can add patches to it.</p>
<p>
I never really felt the need to deeply customize it from the ground up as people have already done the hard work for me. I just cloned Luke Smith&#39;s fork and changed the fonts and colors. It is patched to have support for Xresources themeing, changing font scale, scrolling, and much more.</p>
<p>
I also have URxvt installed and customized as a backup incase something breaks one day because it offers almost the same experience. They look identical with certain customizations. The reaason I don&#39;t use it is because I don&#39;t know perl make it more extensible with scripts.</p>

File Manager - Emacs Dired
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-17" class="outline-text-3">
<p>It&#39;s pretty basic and easy to use. It is just a text buffer in Emacs that you can manipulate with its built-in functions. You can even generate thumbnails with it if you are in a directory with pictures with image-dired. Because its part of Emacs, it benefits from the extensibility of it.</p>
<p>

<h3 id="headline-18">
dmenu
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-18" class="outline-text-3">
<p>dmenu stands for dynamic menu. A user can input options with stdin and select one with dmenu and get an output to stdout.</p>
<p>
This is useful for scripts like my dired_selector scripts that gives me a selection of predefined directories and when I choose one, it opens a dired buffer in Emacs with that directory.</p>
<p>
dmenu can also be used as a launcher for programs in a minimalist window manager. The options are nearly limitless.</p>
<p>
Because this is suckless software, features can be added in. The only patches I have added are the Xresources, center, and lineheight patches that make it look nice.</p>

Notification Daemon - dunst
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-19" class="outline-text-3">
<p>dunst is a minimal notification daemon. I don&#39;t really get a lot of notifications, but it&#39;s there for when I do. You can add sounds to it, rice it, script it and much more. Check out <a href="https://dunst-project.org/">the dunst project website</a> to learn about more of its features.</p>

Image Viewer - nsxiv
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-20" class="outline-text-3">
<p>nsxiv is a pretty basic image viewer. It has a nice gallery mode and I made it able to select/set my wallpaper with a feh script. It has stdin/stdout capabilities, just like most other suckless software.</p>
